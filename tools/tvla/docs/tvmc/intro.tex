\section{Introduction}

$\tvmc$ is a tool for analysis and verification of concurrent
systems. In contrast to existing verification tools (e.g.
\cite{lncs962*453}) $\tvmc$ is geared towards verification of
concurrent software with dynamic allocation of objects and
threads. $\tvmc$ provides a powerful abstraction mechanism by
using $3$-valued logic to represent multiple program
configurations. $\tvmc$ is an extension of the TVLA framework
\cite{kn:TalSAS00}. Theoretical background for $\tvmc$ can be
found in \cite{Yahav01}.

In this paper, we will show how to perform verification of the
simple Java program given in \figref{MutexJava}.
