\section{Initial Configurations}

A new set of nodes denoted by \%t corresponds to the threads in
the initial configuration. For example: \%t = \{ $s_t(main)$ \}
defines a new thread instance of thread-type "main". The name of
the instance is $``s_t''$. Unless explicitly stated by the
$ready(v)$ predicate, the thread is assumed to be not ready for
scheduling. The thread starts execution from its entry label. You
may create a configuration in which a thread starts at a given
label, by supplying the initial label as a second parameter -
$s_t(main,gl_3)$.

\figref{TmutexTVS} shows an initial configuration for the mutual
exclusion example. This initial configuration consists of a
summary node of threads, and a single lock. Note that the thread
node \emph{s\_t} is given the value $1/2$ for the predicate
\textbf{sm} to denote the fact that it is a summary node.
