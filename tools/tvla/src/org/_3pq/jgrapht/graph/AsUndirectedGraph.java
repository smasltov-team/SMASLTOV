/**
 * An undirected view of the backing directed graph specified in the
 * constructor.  This graph allows modules to apply algorithms designed for
 * undirected graphs to a directed graph by simply ignoring edge direction. If
 * the backing directed graph is an <a
 * href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/OrientedGraph.html"> oriented graph</a>,
 * then the view will be a simple graph; otherwise, it will be a multigraph.
 * Query operations on this graph "read through" to the backing graph.
 * Attempts to add edges will result in an
 * <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code>, but vertex addition/removal and
 * edge removal are all supported (and immediately reflected in the backing
 * graph).
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that edges returned by this graph's accessors are really just the edges
 * of the underlying directed graph.  Since there is no interface distinction
 * between directed and undirected edges, this detail should be irrelevant to
 * algorithms.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This graph does <i>not</i> pass the hashCode and equals operations through
 * to the backing graph, but relies on <tt>Object</tt>'s <tt>equals</tt> and
 * <tt>hashCode</tt> methods.  This graph will be serializable if the backing
 * graph is serializable.
 * </p>
