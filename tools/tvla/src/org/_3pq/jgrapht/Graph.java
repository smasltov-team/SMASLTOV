/**
 * The root interface in the graph hierarchy.  A mathematical graph-theory
 * graph object <tt>G(V,E)</tt> contains a set <tt>V</tt> of vertices and a
 * set <tt>E</tt> of edges. Each edge e=(v1,v2) in E connects vertex v1 to
 * vertex v2. for more information about graphs and their related definitions
 * see <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Graph.html">
 * http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Graph.html</a>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This library generally follows the terminology found at: <a
 * href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/topics/GraphTheory.html">
 * http://mathworld.wolfram.com/topics/GraphTheory.html</a>. Implementation of
 * this interface can provide simple-graphs, multigraphs, pseudographs etc.
 * The package <code>org._3pq.jgrapht.graph</code> provides a gallery of
 * abstract and concrete graph implementations.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This library works best when vertices represent arbitrary objects and edges
 * represent the relationships between them.  Vertex and edge instances may be
 * shared by more than one graph.
